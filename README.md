Background

The United States Geological Survey, commonly referred to as USGS, holds the responsibility of supplying scientific data related to natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental conditions, and the impacts of climate change and land-use decisions. USGS scientists continually work on creating innovative tools and techniques to deliver timely, pertinent, and practical information concerning the Earth and its dynamic processes.

Overview

For this assignment, I utilized earthquake data from the past day, obtained from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) dataset available at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. The objective was to visualize this earthquake dataset and create an informative map using the Leaflet library. The map was designed to display earthquake locations based on their latitude and longitude coordinates. To enhance the user experience, popups were integrated, providing additional details about each earthquake when a user clicks on its respective marker.

A legend was incorporated into the map to provide context and interpretation for the displayed data. The legend offers information about the depth categories and their corresponding colors to help users understand the depth of each earthquake.

The resulting visualization resembles the sample map provided as a reference, offering a comprehensive view of earthquake data within the designated timeframe.

Components:
- Utilized USGS earthquake data from the past day.
- Designed a dynamic map using the Leaflet library.
- Plotted earthquake locations based on latitude and longitude.
- Implemented popups to provide detailed information when markers are clicked.
- Created a legend to offer context and depth classification for the map data.
